Noodle is a replication of the Moodle platform used at INSA Lyon, but with the more user-friendly interface of Netflix. It provides a user interface that showcases a list of courses and their associated digital resources. This project was developed as part of a web programming course, leveraging the MERN stack: the front end is powered by React.js and the course and document database is implemented using MongoDB.
